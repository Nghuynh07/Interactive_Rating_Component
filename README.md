### What I learned

I started to use SASS for this project. I learned that when a star is clicked its 'active' class needs to be inside of the 'container' (parent) class. I am not entirely sure the reason behind this but SASS wouldn't pick up the effect (color and background changes). In in the console, changes were made correctly. My guess is that normal CSS is more forgiven when writing CSS. For SASS; however, because everything is nested; so a nested class needs to be inside of its parent.
